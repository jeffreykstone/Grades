# Description:  This program calculates how many quiz questions can be dropped and still receive an A in CS 161.
# This program assumes 100% performance on assignments, which are worth 70% of grade.
# Quizzes are worth 30% of grade.
# An A requires 93%, A- = 90%, B+ = 87%, B = 83%, B- = 80%, C+ = 77%, C = 73%, C- = 70%, etc.
# Thus Quiz(.3)+Assignments(.7) = 1 or (.3Q + .7A) / (.3 + .7) = 100
# Since we need 93 for an A and 100(.7) = 70, we need a 23 out of 30 on the quizzes to get an A.
# There are a total of 224 points possible on the quizzes (8 quizzes, each with 7 problems valued at 7 points/question).
